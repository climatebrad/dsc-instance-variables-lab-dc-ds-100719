    "Your next challenge is to build a function to find a driver with a given name. The function should take two inputs: drivers and search_name. Drivers will be a list of driver objects (instances of the class you defined above) and search_name will be a string for the driver name you wish to search from. The function should then return the first driver object from drivers whose name is an exact match to the search name.
